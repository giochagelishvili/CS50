# University of Harvard - CS50

I am proud to present my repository, which represents the culmination of my hard work and dedication throughout Harvard's rigorous CS50 course. This course allowed me to further develop my skills in a variety of programming languages, including C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, while also refreshing my understanding of HTML and CSS.

Throughout the course, I encountered a wide range of challenging problems that required significant effort, determination, and focus to solve. However, I am pleased to say that my perseverance paid off, and I was able to successfully overcome each obstacle.

The repository contains all of my work from week 0 to week 7, neatly organized into different folders. Overall, my experience with CS50 was both rewarding and enjoyable, and I am confident that the skills and knowledge I gained will serve me well in my future endeavors as a programmer.
