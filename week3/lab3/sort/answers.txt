sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: At the end of the lecture 3 we saw a little
video about the performance of these three sorting algorithms.
Fastest one was, of course, merge sort (took couple of seconds to sort),
selection sort and bubble sort looked like they were going at the same speed,
but as selection algorithm sorted more and more it became faster. At the end
selection sort was second fastest sorting algorithm. Even though selection sort
and bubble sort both has O(n2), selection sort is still faster than bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: sort2 took 0m0.065s to sort reversed 10000
and 0m0.055s to sort random 10000. sort2 was the fastest
amongst these three sorts.
sort1 took 0m0.344s for reversed and sort3 took 0m0.213s for reversed.
since merge sort is fastest between these three sorting algorithms,
I think sort2 uses merge sort.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Explained in sort1.
