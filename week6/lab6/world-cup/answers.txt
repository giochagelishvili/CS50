Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

A few countries had below 1% chance of winning in 1000 simulations. These chances went to 0% as we increased number of simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would say predictions would be good enough after 10000 simulations.
